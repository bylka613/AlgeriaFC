**Algerian referee Mustapha Ghorbal has been appointed by FIFA to take charge of the 2022 FIFA Club World Cup final between Real Madrid and Al Hilal.**

The 37-year old Ghorbal was the 4th official in last year's Club World Cup final between Chelsea and Palmeiras in Abu Dhabi. 

The Oran native is no stranger to the big stage having refereed games at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, as well as the final of the 2022 CAF Champions League. Ghorbal was also in charge of the crucial World Cup qualifier between Senegal and Egypt.
