**Said Benrahma made history last night in Prague when he became the first ever Algerian player to win the recently launched UEFA Conference League.**

The 27-year old winger started and was on target for the Hammers, converting a second half penalty, in the 2-1 win over Fiorentina.

Benrahma becomes just the 2nd Algerian after Rabah Madjer to win a European title and score in a European final.
