**A date with destiny awaits Algeria international Riyad Mahrez as his Manchester City side take on Inter Milan in the final of the 2023 UEFA Champions League. After winning the Premier League title and the FA Cup, City are after an elusive the European title, and a historic treble.**

For 32-year old Riyad Mahrez, tomorrow's final in Istanbul is a date with destiny, with the Desert Foxes captain looking to become just the second ever Algerian player to win the Champions League, after Rabah Madjer did it back in 1987.

It remains to be seen whether Mahrez will start for Pep Guardiola's side tomorrow night against Inter Milan. Mahrez has not started for City in the Champions League in any of the last 5 games, and was also an unused sub in last weekend's FA Cup final against Manchester United.

Despite his lack of minutes, Mahrez was seen having a lengthy discussion with Pep Guardiola at the end of today's training session, giving Algeria fans a glimmer of hope that he could start tomorrow.
