**After a month on the sidelines with an injury, Algeria international midfielder Ismael Bennacer marked his return to training with AC Milan today.**

The 25-year old has been sidelined for Milan since January 24th, when he last featured for the Rossoneri in a 4-0 loss to Lazio. 

The return of Bennacer will be a big boost for Stefano Pioli's side ahead of their crucial Champions League return leg tie against Tottenham. The Italian side won the first leg 1-0 at the San Siro Stadium and will look to advance to the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the first time since 2012.
