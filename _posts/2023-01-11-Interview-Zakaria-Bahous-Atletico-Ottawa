Zakaria Bahous is an Algerian-Canadian football player who currently plays for Atlético Ottawa in the Canadian Premier League. In his first season, Bahous played a key role in helping Atlético Ottawa, which is owned by Spanish club Atlético Madrid, win the regular season championship and reach the final of the play-offs. 

We caught up with the Montreal native to talk about his first season at the professional level and his goals for the future.

**For starters, can you introduce yourself?**<br>
My name is Zakaria Bahous, I'm 21 years old and I play for Atlético Ottawa. I play as a midfielder, but I can also play as a striker or winger. 

**What's your preferred position?**<br>
Attacking midfielder.

**How did you end up at Atlético Ottawa?**<br>
I'm originally from Montreal, I played one season in CEGEP (college) and a few seasons in the PLSQ (Quebec Provincial League) and I got noticed by an agent out there. I won a few trophies and had a good season in CEGEP and caught the attention of some Canadian Premier League teams. From there, I spoke with my agent and discussed the options and found that the best fit for me was Atlético Ottawa.

**How was your first season at the professional level?**<br>
ANSWER

**Last season, you spent the pre-season in Madrid training at the Atlético Madrid facilities. How was that experience?**<br>
Amazing, really amazing .. it was really something different, especially for me with it being my first season and Madrid being my first experience in the professional world. We got to compare ourselves with some of the teams out there, and it went really good.

**You have a Spanish coaching staff with a different style and perspective on football compared to Canadian football. What's it like working with them and learning from them?**
Obviously it's different, but in a good way. It expands the learning we have as players, and they bring something different to each one of us and that makes us a really good team. Amazing coaches, amazing staff.

**On a personal level, what is your long-term objective?**<br>
Like any young player, you always dream of going as far as you can go. I just take things step by step and focus on the season, and hope to get as far as I can get.

**What advice would you give young players trying to take their game to the next level?**<br>
It's important to understand how you play, and to keep playing your way of playing football, but also listen to your experienced teammates and try to take from that. As well 
At the end of the day, we all play football because we love the game, 

**Where are you originally from in Algeria?**<br>
My parents are from Sidi Bel Abbes but I have not been back in a while because of football.

**Do you watch the national team play and if so do you have a favorite player?**<br>
Yes, of course .. I don't have a favorite player. Most player would say Riyad Mahrez, he's amazing
