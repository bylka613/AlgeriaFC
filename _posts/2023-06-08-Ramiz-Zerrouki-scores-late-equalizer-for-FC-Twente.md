**In his second last match for FC Twente, Ramiz Zerrouki scored an all-important 93rd minute equalizer for his club in a 1-1 draw against Sparta Rotterdam in the their Eredivisie UEFA Conference League playoff.**

With his side losing 1-0, Zerrouki rose high to head home the equalizer in the dying minutes of the game, giving FC Twente the advantage going into the return leg at home. The winner of the tie qualifies to next season's UEFA Conference League. 

The 25-year old midfielder will leave Twente this summer to join Dutch champions Feyenoord.
