**For starters, can you introduce yourself?**<br>
My name is Zakaria Bahous, I'm 21 years old and I play for Atlético Ottawa. I play as a midfielder, but I can also play as a striker or winger. 

**What's your preferred position?**<br>
Attacking midfielder.

**How did you end up at Atlético Ottawa?**<br>
I'm originally from Montreal, I played one season in CEGEP (college) and a few seasons in the PLSQ (Quebec Provincial League) and I got noticed by an agent out there. I won a few trophies and had a good season in CEGEP and caught the attention of some Canadian Premier League teams. From there, I spoke with my agent and discussed the options and found that the best fit for me was Atlético Ottawa.

**How was your first season at the professional level?**<br>
ANSWER

**Last season, you spent the pre-season in Madrid training at the Atlético Madrid facilities. How was that experience?**<br>
