**After booking their place in the quarter-finals of the CAF Champions League, both Chabab Belouizdad and JS Kabylie are now ranked in the top 10 in CAF's latest club rankings.**

Chabab Belouizdad, which has now reached the quarter-finals for three straight seasons, sits in the 7th spot in the latest CAF rankings, while JS Kabylie, finalists of the CAF Confederation Cup two seasons ago, are ranked 10th. Both clubs can move even further up the rankings if they advance even further in this year's Champions League.

The results of the two Algerian clubs further cement the Algerian league's place as the third top ranked league in Africa, behind only the Moroccan and Egyptian leagues.
