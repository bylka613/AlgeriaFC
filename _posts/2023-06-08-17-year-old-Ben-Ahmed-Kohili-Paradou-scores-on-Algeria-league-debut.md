**17-year old Paradou striker Ben Ahmed Kohili became the youngest player to score in the Algerian league in almost 8 years when he found the net against Mouloudia Oran on Tuesday.**

Making his league debut for Paradou, Kohili first obtained a penalty, converted by Reda Hamidi, before scoring his own penalty in the second half.

The striker, who was born in July 2005, has scored over 30 goals for Paradou's youth ranks this season, while playing for the U17, U19 and U21 teams. He has also featured for Paradou's first team in the Algerian Cup.

Kohili becomes the second 17-year old to feature for Paradou this season after Mohamed Ramdaoui.
