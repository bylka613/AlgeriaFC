**The 2022 Africa Nations Championship (CHAN) kicks off today in Algeria with hosts Algeria taking on Libya at the newly completed Nelson Mandela Stadium in Algiers.**

The host Desert Foxes, coached by former Algeria international defender Madjid Bougherra, are participating in their first CHAN tournament since 2011, where they finished fourth in Sudan. Libya on the other hand will be participating in their fifth CHAN and third in a row. The Mediterranean Knights also previously won the competition in 2014, defeating Ghana on penalties in the final.

Both sides will look to get their campaign off to a positive start in a Group A that also features Ethiopia and Mozambique, who play each other tomorrow in the same stadium.
