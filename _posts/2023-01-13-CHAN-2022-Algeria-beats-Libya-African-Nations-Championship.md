**Algeria started its 2022 African Nations Championship campaign with a 1-0 win over Libya at the newly inaugurated Nelson Mandela Stadium in Algiers in the opening match of the tournament.**

After a scoreless first half, Algeria broke the deadlock in the 57th minute after Aymen Mahious obtained and converted a penalty. The USM Algiers striker pounced on an errant back pass and was brought down in the box by Libya's goalkeeper Muad Ellafi. The 25-year old stepped up and cooly slotted home from the spot to give the Desert Foxes the lead.

Libya had a number of chances to equalize in the final 30 minutes, including a shot from Ali Salama which came off the post but Algeria held on for the all-important win.

Midfielder Houssem Mrezigue, who put in a industrious shift in the center of the park, was chosen as the Player of the Match. 

Algeria will face Ethiopia next on Tuesday, while Libya takes on Mozambique.
