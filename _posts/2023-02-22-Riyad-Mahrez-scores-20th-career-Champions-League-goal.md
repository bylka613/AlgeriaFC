**Riyad Mahrez was on the scoresheet for Manchester City today in their 1-1 draw against RB Leipzig in the knockout stage of the UEFA Champions League.**

The Algeria captain started the match for the Cityzens and opened the scoring in the 27th minute with a well placed shot from the edge of the box. 

It was Mahrez's 20th career goal in the UEFA Champions League, becoming just the 5th ever African player to reach the 20-goal milestone in the competition, joining the likes of Mohamed Salah, Didier Drogba, Samuel Eto'o and Sadio Mané.

Mahrez has now scored in every game he has played against RB Leipzig, also scoring in both games against the Bundesliga side last season.
