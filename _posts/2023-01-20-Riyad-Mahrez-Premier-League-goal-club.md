**Riyad Mahrez scored a brace yesterday against Tottenham to become just the 6th ever African player to reach the 80 goal milestone in the history of the Premier League.**

The Algerian winger was instrumental in Manchester City's 4-2 win against Spurs at the Etihad, scoring 2 goals and adding an assist as the Cityzens came down from a 2-0 halftime deficit to get the 3 points.

Mahrez now has 81 career Premier League goals, becoming just the 6th ever African goal to reach the 80 goal milestone, joining an illustrious group that includes Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mané, Didier Drogba, Emmanuel Adebayor and Yakubu.

Mahrez's assist against Spurs also takes his career total in the Premier League to 53, and now needs just two more assists to catch Didier Drogba as Africa's top assistman in the history of the PL.
