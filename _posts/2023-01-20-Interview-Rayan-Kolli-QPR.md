*Rayan Kolli is a young Algerian-English footballer who recently signed his first professional with English Championship club Queens Park Rangers FC. Earlier this season, the 17-year old London native also trained with the QPR first team after some scintillating performances with the youth team.

We caught up with Rayan Kolli for a short interview.

**For starters, can you introdce yourself.**<br>
My name is Rayan Kolli, I'm 17 years old and play as a forward and attacking midfielder for Queens Park Rangers.

**You've been at QPR since you were 8 years old, how did you join the club?**<br>
I went to one of the community sessions that QPR set up with one of my friends just for fun and I ended up getting told to stop an hour into the session because I would be training with the academy the next day.

**You recently signed your first pro contract with QPR after almost 10 years at the club. How did that feel?**<br>
Signing a professional contract is an amazing feeling, especially because it is my first one. I have sacrificed and dedicated a lot of time and effort to earn this so I’m very happy to make my family proud.

**What are you short and long term objectives?**<br>
Now that I’ve signed a professional contract, which was initially one of my short term goals for this season, it's now to make my debut with the first team Inshallah. A long term goal would be to become a regular starter within the QPR first team and represent Algeria in major tournaments.

**Speaking of Algeria, have you ever been contacted by the Algerian FA?**<br>
I was contacted only once for the 2021 U17 Africa Cup of Nations but the tournament was cancelled and I haven’t been contacted at all since then.

**Earlier this season, you trained with the QPR first team. Tell us a bit about that experience.**<br>
Training with the first team was a very good experience but also a very tough one. It made me realise how hard you have to work to get there and compete with experienced players. They also demanded a lot from you when coming up, so you can’t get away with not doing your job properly.

**Where are you originally from Algeria? Do you go back often?**<br>
Both my families from my mother to my father live in the capital Algiers, so I have been going back there every single year since I was a very young. My Dad grew up in Setif as well as Algiers so that’s where I get my love for ES Sétif.
