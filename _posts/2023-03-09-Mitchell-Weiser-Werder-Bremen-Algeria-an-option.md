**Werder Bremen right-back Mitchell Weiser has declared that playing for Algeria is a potential option for him. The 28-year old German-born Weiser has previously represented Germany at the youth level but is eligible for Algeria via his mother.**

"Algeria has always been an option in my mind," said Weiser in a press conference. "I have the luxury to play theoretically for both nations (Germany and Algeria). It has always been a big goal to play a big tournament and my chances are higher to achieve this goal with Algeria. I will be 29 years old, so I do not have so much time left in my career. If everything goes well, maybe 7 or 8 years .. and I want to achieve as much as possible in my career." 

"The time has come for me now. I was never quite sure. I don't see myself being drawn to any particular country, I see the world without borders. Of course in football we have to take a decision. I have the option to play for one of the two countries."

"I have never been there and I have no big connections to Algeria. My grandfather is often there, I have regular contact with him. I don’t know what you else want to hear but I have never been there. I also don’t know the culture there and I don’t know how it is to live there but I like adventures and I like to put myself in situations which challenge me and that’s in any case also a decision to play for Algeria."

It remains to be seen whether Weiser is part of the plans of Algeria national team coach Djamel Belmadi, especially with the lack of options at his right-back position.
