**Algeria international midfielder Hicham Boudaoui has extended his contract with French Ligue 1 club Nice until 2027.**

Boudaoui's contract was set to expire this summer but the 23-year old has chosen to extend his stay at the Allianz Riviera. 

“I’m really happy to extend my adventure here,” Boudaoui said after signing his extension. “I will continue to develop with Nice and will do everything to make the fans happy. There’s still some good things for us to accomplish.”

Boudaoui, who joined Nice from Paradou for an Algerian league record of €4 million, has made 14 appearances this season.
