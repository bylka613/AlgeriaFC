**Algeria under-23 national team coach Noureddine Ould Ali has called up 28 players to prepare for the upcoming pair of U23 Africa Cup qualifiers against Ethiopia.**

With the ties against Ethiopia falling outside of the FIFA international window, Ould Ali will have to rely on a mostly domestic squad. The 50-year old manager has called up 26 players plying their trade in the domestic league, and another 2 players playing in France.

The Algeria U23 national team was reinstated into the U23 Africa Cup qualifiers after DR Congo was disqualified for fielding an ineligible player in the 2019 qualifiers. Both Algeria and Ethiopia were eliminated by DR Congo.

The first leg will take place on March 8th or 9th in Ethiopia, with the return leg to take place in Algeria on March 12th or 13th.
