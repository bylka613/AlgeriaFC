**Mehdi Tahrat scored his first goal of the season today in the 2-2 draw against Al Rayyan with a brilliant long range strike from outside the box.**

In the 12th minute, Tahrat intercepted a pass, dribbled past one defender before unleashing a rocket that left no chance for the opposing keeper.

It's Tahrat's second career goal in the QSL, with his previous goal also coming against Al Rayyan. Fellow Algerians Yacine Brahimi, Farid Boulaya and Ishak Belfodil, all started for Al Gharafa, with Belfodil scoring the team's second goal.
