**Algerian forward Abderrahman Rebbach was instrumental in Deportivo Alaves 2-0 win over Eibar last night in the Spanish second division promotion playoffs. Rebbach opened the scoring in the 1st minute and sealed the game in the 89th minute with an assist to help Alaves reach the final of the promotion playoffs.**

The Blida native, who has lived in Spain since age 12, opened the scoring in the 1st minute with a perfectly placed header to give Alaves the lead. In the dying minutes, Rebbach put Asier Villalibre through on goal, and the latter doubled the lead to seal the tie and send Alaves to the final.

In the final, Alaves will face Levate, with the winner getting promoted to La Liga.
