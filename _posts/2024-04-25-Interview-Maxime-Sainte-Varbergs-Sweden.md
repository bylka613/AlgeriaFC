Maxime Sainte is a 22-year old Swedish-Algerian footballer playing with Varbegs BoIS in Sweden. Last season, Sainte made 19 appearances for his club in the Swedish Allsvenskan, the top flight of Swedish football.

We caught up with Maxime for a short interview. 

**For starters, can you introduce yourself to our readers.**
I started playing football when I was 4 years old, I started playing with AIK (in Stockholm). I also played in Hammarby.

**What are your strenghts as a footballer?**
My strengths are my speed and my technique.

**You are born in Sweden but you are of Algerian descent. What is your link to Algeria? Have you ever been?**
I was born in Sweden but my mother is from Algeria. I went to Algeria once when I was young but I don't remember any of it. I have talked to my mom about going back as soon as possible, it would be fantastic.

**What are your objectives for this season ? And your objectives for the future ?**
My objective is to go as far as possible and to play outside of Sweden.
