**Algeria under-17 national team coach Arezki Remane announced today his final squad for the 2023 U17 Africa Cup of Nations, which Algeria will be hosting starting on April 29th.**

The young Desert Foxes will face Somalia, Senegal and Congo, in Group A action at the Nelson Mandela Stadium in Algiers, with the top two teams in the group qualifying automatically to the quarterfinals.

Remane's squad has remained largely unchanged in the lead-up to the Africa Cup, with the U17 coach relying mainly on players from the Algerian FA Academy and Paradou AC, as well as a number of foreign-based players from France, Spain and Canada.
