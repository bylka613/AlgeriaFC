*Rafik Belghali intro*

We caught up with Rafik Belghali for an interview.

**QUESTION**
ANSWER

**CAREER**
I played one season with Sint-Truidense before joining PSV Eindhoven where I stayed for one year. After that, I returned to Belgium and played with Lierse SK for two seasons before joining the Zulte-Waregem academy, known as Essevee Soccer School, where we learned to play barefoot. I spent five seasons there. I then suffered an injury and spent a year away from football before signging with Lommel SK. It's my third season with here and my second with the pros. 

**ALGERIA**
My mom is from AÃ¯n Sefra and my dad is from Chlef. Algeria means a lot to me, it's my country, the country of my parents and the country of all my family. I feel more Algerian than I do Belgian.
