**Fares Chaïbi came off the bench to score the winning goal for Toulouse in the 2-1 win over Annecy in the French Cup semi-final. The goal sends Toulouse to its first French Cup final since 1957!**

With the score 1-1 in the 85th minute, Chaïbi pounced on an errant back pass by an Annecy defender and chipped it over the keeper to send Toulouse to the final. 

Toulouse will face Nantes in the 2023 French Cup final, a match that will pit Chaibi against Jaouen Hadjem, another youngster who recently made his Algeria national team debut.
