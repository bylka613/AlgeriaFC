**Former Algeria international Yassine Benzia has joined 9 time Azerbaijan champions Qarabag FK, signing a contract until 2025.**

The 28-year old midfielder did not feature for French Ligue 2 club Dijon this season and was allowed to leave with his contract set to expire this summer.

The Olympique Lyon youth product joins his 7th senior side after Lyon, Lille, Fenerbahce, Olympiacos, Dijon and Hatayspor. 

Benzia had 4 caps for Algeria between 2016 and 2018, scoring 1 international goal in a 2-0 win over Seychelles.
