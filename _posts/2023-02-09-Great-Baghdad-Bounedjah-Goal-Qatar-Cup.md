**A great solo goal from Baghdad Bounedjah proved to be the winner as Al Sadd advanced to the final of the Qatar Cup with a 3-1 win over Al Arabi.**

Just before half-time, with the score already 1-0 in favour of Al-Sadd, Bounedjah picked up the ball at the edge of the box and dribbled past 3 players to slot it home past the keeper to double the lead.

Al-Sadd added a 3rd goal in the second half before conceding a late goal to come out victorious and advance to the final of the Qatar Cup.
