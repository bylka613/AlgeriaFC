INTRO

*We caught up with Mammar .. *

**For starters, can you introduce yourself to our readers.**<br>
My name is Abdelkarim Mammar Chaouche. I was born in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1996 to an Algerian father and a Finnish mother. I currently playing for Degerfors IF in the Swedish Allsvenskan (top flight). I play as left back and left wingback. 

**Tell us about your career so far.**
I started my career in Vasalunds IF in Stockholm. Then i moved to Algeria playing a season with Widad Boufarik and NA Hussein Dey before moving back to Sweden to play in the lower division and Making small moves until i got to 2 division playing in AFC Eskilstuna as captain scoring 8 goals and 10 assist as left back. Then Degerfors bought me.

**This past weekend you made your Allsvenskan debut at age 26 after a long journey in football. How did that feel to finally make it?**<br>
First of all i Thank Allah. Im so grateful to finally make my debut. It was amazing atmosphere and it felt really good

**On your debut you played against your former teammate at Norrby Abdelrahman Saidi, who is also Swedish-Algerian. Talk to us a bit him as a player and the relationship you have with him.**<br>
Me and Abdo played together before in Norrby. We are close friends outside the pitch, we often talk about our dream to play for the national team one day together Inshaallah . Abdo is a technical player who likes to get the ball and go one against one, Also have good shots and really good with the ball

**You're born in Sweden but also spent time living in Algeria. What does Algeria represent for you?**<br>
I have a big family in algeria and always traveled there since i was a kid. I love algeria and the people

**We’re almost halfway through Ramadan. How do you balance your faith and and a physically demanding sport like football?**<br>
The first days of ramadan is tough but then it becomes a routine, so focusing on prayers and my deen helps me trough the day. Eating good and healthy and getting enough Sleep is the key for me during ramadan
Also feeling that fasting makes me much lighter on the pitch. Here in sweden is long days but the weather is cold so no problem here at all with fasting

**What would you say are your strengths and weaknesses on the pitch?**<br>
Im physical, strong, fast and likes to Run up and down all the game. Also have good crossing. I need to work on my positional defending and arial duels

**What are your objectives for this season? And long term?**<br>
I Hope to play many games and develope Every game also win games with my team. Long term taking steps in europe and Inshaallah one day algerian national team

**You spent time playing in Algeria with Widad Boufarik and Nasr Hussein Dey. What was that experience like both on and off the pitch?**<br>
 was around 18 years old when i played there. The difference is it was many old players compared to in europe where you already play in mens team when you are 17-25 years old. In algeria everyone was around 28-35. So there were more experienced players but a bit slower and not so physical like in europe and Sweden. I had a good time and also algeria has very good fans. So i enjoyed playing there.
 The biggest difference was that in algeria everyone loves football. So outside the pitch everyone Talking about the upcoming games and also travels long way from home without money just to support their club
 
 **Thank you for taking the time to do this interview, we really appreciate it. Did you have any last words for our readers?**<<br>
 You are welcome. I just say that Inshaallah they Will se me play someday for algeria
