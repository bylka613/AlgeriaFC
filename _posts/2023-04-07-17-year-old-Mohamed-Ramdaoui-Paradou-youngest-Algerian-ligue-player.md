**17-year old Mohamed Ramdaoui started for Paradou AC against USM Khenchela this past week to become the youngest player to play in the Algerian Ligue 1 this season.**

Ramdaoui, who was born in 2005, started his career at Widad Tlemcen before joining the Algerian FA Academy at Khemis Miliana. Last season, he was the youngest player to play in the Algerian 2nd division when he featured for SKAF Khemis Miliana. The 17-year old striker joined Paradou this season and impressed with the U21 team, earning himself a promotion to the first team.

Ramdaoui is one of three Paradou youth strikers destined for big things along with Ben Ahmed Kohili and Aymen Chegra.
