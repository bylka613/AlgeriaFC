Three Algerians were involved in today's fixtures in the English Premier League, including another edition of the Manchester derby at Old Trafford.

**Manchester United 2-1 Manchester City**<br>
Riyad Mahrez started and played the full 90 minutes for Manchester City in their derby against crosstown rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford. Mahrez was involved in the build-up for the City goal, setting up Kevin De Bruyne with a through ball that ultimately led to a Jack Grealish goal. Unfortunately, the Cityzens were on the wrong side of the 2-1 scoreline, conceding two late goals to fall further behind league leaders Arsenal.

**Wolverhampton Wanderers 1-0 West Ham United**<br>
Both Rayan Ait Nouri and Said Benrahma started on their bench for their respective sides and came on as second half substitutes. Benrahma was brought on by David Moyes in the 60th minute with his side trailing 1-0, while Rayan Ait Nouri made his appearance a few minutes later. The score remained unchanged as Wolves were finally able to put an end to a 4 match winless sterak, while West Ham have now won just 1 out of their last 6 matches.
