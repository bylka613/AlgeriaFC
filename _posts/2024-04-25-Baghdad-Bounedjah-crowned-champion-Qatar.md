**Algeria international striker Baghdad Bounedjah has been crowned champion of the Qatar Stars League with Al Sadd for the fourth time in his career.**

Al Sadd beat Al Shamal 4-0 yesterday to ensure their 17th league title and their fourth since 2019. Bounedjah started the match on the bench and came on in the second half to help Al Sadd seal the trophy.

The 32-year old Oran native, who has 8 goals and 4 assists in 19 league appearances this season, is set to leave the Qatari club when his contract expires this summer.

Bounedjah joined Al Sadd back in 2016 and is the club's all-time top goalscorer with 218 goals in all competitions.
