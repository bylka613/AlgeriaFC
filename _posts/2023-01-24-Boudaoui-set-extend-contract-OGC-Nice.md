**Algeria international midfielder Hicham Boudaoui is all set to extend his contract with French Ligue 1 club OGC Nice.**

The Paradou academy product has been in talks with the club to sign a contract extension and has reached an agreement to extend until 2026.

Boudaoui joined Nice in 2019 from Paradou AC for a record transfer fee of €4 million, becoming the most expensive transfer in the history of the Algerian Ligue 1.

Since joining, Boudaoui has cemented himself as a regular for Nice and this season has established himself as a starter in the middle.
